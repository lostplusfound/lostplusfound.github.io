## üìã Overview

**What The Fed?** is a prototype civic tech app built for my AP Government & Politics Civic Project. It‚Äôs also my first major **Flutter** application, and it explores how **AI** can empower citizens by making U.S. government activity more transparent and understandable.

With historically low voter turnout and declining civic trust, many Americans feel disconnected from government. **What The Fed?** uses AI to change that ‚Äî delivering simplified summaries of legislation, congressional floor activity, and key political updates.

## ‚ú® Features

- **AI-Powered Legislative Summaries**  
  Get concise, plain-English explanations of complex government proceedings.

- **Real-Time Bill Tracking**  
  Follow legislation through Congress and receive timely updates.

- **Congressional Insights**  
  Stay informed about current debates, floor votes, and hearings.

- **Conversational Chatbot**  
  Interact with a Gemini-powered AI assistant to deepen your understanding.

- **User-Centered UI**  
  Built with Flutter to ensure a smooth experience across platforms.

## üîß Technical Highlights

- **Frontend**: Flutter (Deployed on web)
- **AI Integration**: Google's Gemini for summarization and Q&A
- **Data**: Congress.gov API to ensure real-time data about Congress
- **Backend/Hosting**: Firebase Hosting
