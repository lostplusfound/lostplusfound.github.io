## Introduction

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Iâ€™m **Stephen**, a developer focused on civic engagement, digital privacy, and tech for social good. I believe in building tools that empower others â€” and in having fun while doing it.

On this blog, youâ€™ll find a mix of things: thoughts on technology, updates on projects Iâ€™m working on, and occasional deep dives into my latest interests.

This post marks the beginning of something Iâ€™ve wanted to do for a while: to share my journey, in public. Whether itâ€™s a small bug fix, a breakthrough in a side project, or a reflection on tech and society â€” Iâ€™ll be writing it here.

I'm using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme to build this site.
